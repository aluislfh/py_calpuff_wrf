c --- COMMON BLOCK /TMP/ Variables:
c             IRAD - integer  - Type of interpolation
c                                  1 = 1/Radius, 2 = 1/Radius**2
c            IAVET - integer  - (0/1) 1 = use spatial averaging of
c                               temperature
c            NUMWB - integer  - Number of bodies of water to be treated
c                               separately in temperature interpolation.
c                               (Currently hardwired to 1 - not input)
c           TGDEFB - real     - Default temperature gradient below the
c                               mixing height over water (K/m).
c           TGDEFA - real     - Default temperature gradient above the
c                               mixing height over water (K/m).
c            JWAT1 - integer  - Range of land uses to be considered as
c            JWAT2   array      water in the land/water 3-D temperature
c                               calculation for each of NUMWB bodies of
c                               water.
c                               (Currently only 1 allowed)
c           TRADKM - real     - Radius of influence for temperature
c                               interpolation (in km)
c             TRAD - real     - Radius of influence for temperature
c                               interpolation (in grid cells) -
c                               computed from TRADKM and DGRIDKM
c            NUMTS - integer  - Maximum # of sites to include in temperature
c                               interpolation
