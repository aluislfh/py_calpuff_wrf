     CALPUFF Dataset Version 2.1 contains the zone, but earlier versions

      either as a constant or as a table of fractions that depend on the
      magnitude of the NOx concentration:
                             (NO2CALC) -- Default: 1   ! NO2CALC =   1  !
         0 =  Use NO2 directly (NO2 must be in file)

      Single NO2/NOx ratio (0.0 to 1.0) for treating some
      or all NOx as NO2, where [NO2] = [NOX] * RNO2NOX

      Table of NO2/NOx ratios that vary with NOx concentration.
      Provide 14 NOx concentrations (ug/m**3) and the corresponding
      NO2/NOx ratio, with NOx increasing in magnitude.  The ratio used
      for a particular NOx concentration is interpolated from the values
      provided in the table.  The ratio for the smallest tabulated NOx
      concentration (the first) is used for all NOx concentrations less
      than the smallest tabulated value, and the ratio for the largest
      tabulated NOx concentration (the last) is used for all NOx
      concentrations greater than the largest tabulated value.

Plume Model Output Processing Options
-------------------------------------

  Output from models other than CALPUFF and CALGRID can be written in
  the CONC.DAT format and processed by CALPOST.  Plume models such as
  AERMOD typically do not treat CALM hours, and do not include such hours
  in multiple-hour averages, with specific rules about how many calm hours
  can be removed from an average.  This treatment is known as CALM
  PROCESSING.  Calm periods are identified from wind speeds in the
  meteorological data file for the application, which must be identified
  in Input Group 0 as the single-point meteorological data file MET1DAT.
         0 =  Option is not used for CALPUFF/CALGRID output files
         1 =  Apply CALM processing procedures to multiple-hour averages
                          (MCALMPRO) -- Default: 0   ! MCALMPRO =  0  !

  using repeated value notation to select blocks of receptors:

           (-1 OR 1 <= IEGRID <= NX)

       Y index of UR corner (JEGRID) -- Default: -1     ! JEGRID = 102  !
           (-1 OR 1 <= JEGRID <= NY)

  Note: Entire grid is processed if IBGRID=JBGRID=IEGRID=JEGRID=-1


--Specific gridded receptors can also be excluded from CALPOST
  processing by filling a processing grid array with 0s and 1s.  If the
  processing flag for receptor index (i,j) is 1 (ON), that receptor
  will be processed if it lies within the range delineated by IBGRID,
  JBGRID,IEGRID,JEGRID and if LG=T. If it is 0 (OFF), it will not be
  processed in the run.  By default, all array values are set to 1 (ON).

  identify specific gridded receptors to process

!END!


--------------
Subgroup (1a) -- Specific gridded receptors included/excluded
--------------

    Specific gridded receptors are excluded from CALPOST processing
    by filling a processing grid array with 0s and 1s.  A total of
    NGONOFF lines are read here.  Each line corresponds to one 'row'
    in the sampling grid, starting with the NORTHERNMOST row that
    contains receptors that you wish to exclude, and finishing with
    row 1 to the SOUTH (no intervening rows may be skipped).  Within
    a row, each receptor position is assigned either a 0 or 1,
    starting with the westernmost receptor.
       0 = gridded receptor not processed
       1 = gridded receptor processed

    Repeated value notation may be used to select blocks of receptors:
       23*1, 15*0, 12*1

    Because all values are initially set to 1, any receptors north of
    the first row entered, or east of the last value provided in a row,
    remain ON.

              - Use Method 2 for hours without a weather event
         8 =  Background extinction from speciated PM concentrations using

              - Source-induced change in visibility includes the increase in
                extinction of the background aerosol due to the change in the

                sea salt concentrations

              - RH for Fsmall(RH), Flarge(RH), and Fsalt(RH) may be obtained
                from hourly data as in Method 2 or from the FLAG monthly RH
                adjustment factor used for Method 6 where EPA F(RH) tabulation
                is used to infer RH, or monthly Fsmall, Flarge, and Fsalt RH
                adjustment factors can be directly entered.
                Furthermore, a monthly RH factor may be applied to either hourly
                concentrations or daily concentrations to obtain the 24-hour
                extinction.
                These choices are made using the M8_MODE selection.

     which they will be used to obtain valid weather and visual range.
     The first station that contains valid data for an hour will be
     used.  Enter up to MXWSTA (set in PARAMS file) integer station IDs

Plot output options
-------------------

     Plot files can be created for the Top-N, Exceedance, and Echo
     tables selected above.  Two formats for these files are available,
     DATA and GRID.  In the DATA format, results at all receptors are
     listed along with the receptor location [x,y,val1,val2,...].
     In the GRID format, results at only gridded receptors are written,
     using a compact representation.  The gridded values are written in
     rows (x varies), starting with the most southern row of the grid.
     The GRID format is given the .GRD extension, and includes headers
     compatible with the SURFER(R) plotting software.

     A plotting and analysis file can also be created for the daily
     peak visibility summary output, in DATA format only.
